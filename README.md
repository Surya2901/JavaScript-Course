# Section 2- Learn Javascript Programming Language

The course is created with thorough, extensive, but easy-to-follow content that youâ€™ll easily understand and absorb. It starts with the basics, including JavaScript fundamentals, programming, and user interaction.

The curriculum is going to be very hands-on as we walk you from start to finish to become a professional Javascript developer. We will start from the very beginning by teaching you Javascript basics and programming fundamentals, and then execute into real-life practice and be ready for the real world.

While Javascript is complicated for beginners to learn, it is widely used in many web development areas.

This course gets you started with an introduction to JavaScript. It assumes that you're new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.
